## 📌 Project Overview

Communication is a fundamental human need, yet individuals with speech impairments often face challenges in expressing even their most basic requirements. This project presents a **Smart Glove system** designed to assist speech-impaired individuals by translating hand gestures into readable text messages using sensor-based detection.

The system leverages **flex sensors**, an embedded controller, and a display unit to recognize predefined hand gestures and convert them into meaningful messages such as *FOOD*, *HELP*, *DRINK WATER*, and *WASHROOM*. The project also considers future expansion through **IoT and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)** technologies for remote communication and monitoring.

## ❓ Problem Statement

People who are speech-impaired experience difficulty communicating their basic needs in environments where sign language is not understood. This communication gap often leads to dependence on others and delays in receiving assistance. There is a need for an affordable, wearable, and user-friendly system that can bridge this gap by converting hand gestures into readable messages.
